"Synthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles with tunable size and desirable properties is a
foremost thrust area of the biomedical research domain. These features primarily rely on the
synthetic approaches involved, but with advancement in this area, it has been documented
that the synthesis parameters have a direct impact on the morphology and its biomedical
properties"
