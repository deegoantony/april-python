Synthesis of copper nanoparticles _using the green, )chemical method and characterization of
nanoparticles are under exploration+ due to their wide( applications. Recently there is various
research interests are developed in nanotechnology *in the current study copper
nanoparticles are synthesized using two routes. In& the first route the plant extracts of
boerhavia diffusia, achyranthes bidentate, mixed ^plant extracts of boerhavia diffusia, and
achyranthes bidentate are used for the synthesis $of copper nanoparticles. In the second
route, it is synthesized using D â€“ glucose, and !starch. This study investigates an efficient route
for the copper oxide nanoparticles preparation #from 1 MM aqueous CuSO4 using the leaf
extract, 0.1 M in chemical synthesis. @The complete reduction of Cu2+ was observed after 24
hours of the reaction mixture. The color change in the reaction mixture from green to brown
